# Countingsort
### Problem
###### Overview
We very often encounter items that could be put into a basic ***array*** or a ***list***. From time to time we want to [order them topologically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting).
For that concern we employ specific algorithms inuitively called *sorting algorithms*; one of which is called **Countingsort**.
###### Input
Since we are literaly talking about *counting* something we obvously need some sort of numerical values.
### Solution
